# Better-Barber-Bureau
 

## Overview
Moving from Florida here to Atlanta, one of the biggest issues besides finding a place to stay was finding a barber that i could trust and for the rigth price.

for project 3, I created fullstack app that allows clients to have a hub to post their barbers that have gone to, post pictures of their haircut, price and reviews of that specific barber. Also barbers can post and trade barber equipment to one another. 

Word of mouth is the best way to get the business buzzing, and with this app, the client will be able to get that barber buzzing and new clientele
